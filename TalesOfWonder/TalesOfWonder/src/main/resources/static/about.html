            <p><span>Tales Of Wonder </span>is a web-based project focused on building a website for people to read
                online comics featuring multiple categories. The website will be accessible to various users, up to date
                with stories as well as create a friendly and healthy environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nowadays, there has been a wide range of audience who prefer reading comics online rather than
                purchasing printed comic books. This mainly due to its user-friendliness and convenience that comics
                websites have. Although many websites upload comics, it is difficult to keep track of what users read,
                what chapters remain to be finished or what categories to be divided.
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Project: Tales Of Wonder</span> is born to solve those problems.
